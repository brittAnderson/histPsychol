Abstract
--------

Oswald Külpe(1862-1915) was a German psychologist and philosopher, and
the founder of the Würzburg school of psychology. Külpe actively worked
across Leipzig and Würzburg, both in Germany, and educated many pupils.
His significant contributions on such topics as logic, aesthetics, and
philosophy, and his distinct views departed from those of his mentor
Wundt’s and are still relevant for psychological research today.

Early Life and Education
------------------------

Oswald Külpe was born in Latvia and started practicing in Germany with a
career that hatched the origin of a new emphasis in early Psychology on
abstract thinking. Külpe was the guiding force behind the experimental
study of thought processes and his approach is identified with the
Würzburg school of psychology. Külpe’s early academic interests hopped
between history and psychology. After completing a dissertation on
feeling for Wundt at the University of Leipzig Külpe spent eight years
at the Leipzig laboratory. Most of that time he acted as Wundt’s
assistant. Unlike Wundt, Külpe became an adherent of positivism. In 1888
Külpe became a lecturer at the university. He wrote ‘Grundriss der
Psychologie’ in 1893, in which he defined psychology as a science
concerned with experiences dependent on the experiencing individual and
outlined the findings of experimental psychology. In 1894, Külpe was
appointed professor at the University of Würzburg. Under his inspiration
and direction, the institute published some 50 experimental studies
before his departure for the University of Bonn in 1909. Best known is
his research on the effects of attitudes and tasks on perception and the
course of recall and thought. Slowly, Külpe began to form his own ideas
about psychology. Influenced by Ebbinghaus’ research on memory, he began
to wonder if thinking itself might be accessible to introspective
research. Once Külpe had been appointed full professor at Würzburg in
1894, he proceeded, with all the energy and tenacity at his command, to
set up an institute for psychological experimentation. He was supported
by Karl Marbe, who had become a docent at Würzburg in 1894. After two
years, Kiilpe was granted the use of a few rooms by the library, and it
was there that he and Marbe began to experiment, without assistants,
staff, or funds. It was only after Külpe had declined appointments both
to Minister and Stanford that he was able to secure government grants,
and he then hired Ernst Dürr as his first assistant. His successor at
Würzburg was Marbe, and Marbe’s first assistant was Kurt Koffka.

Professional Activities
-----------------------

-  In 1888 Külpe wrote his habilitation thesis on the doctrine of the
   will in recent psychology, Wundt published `this
   article <http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit4166>`__ in
   his Philosophical Studies. This journal is edited by Wundt himself
   and it’s the first journal devoted primarily to experimental
   psychology. Külpe was therefore qualified as a lecturer at Leipzig
   University. At the time, Wundt’s first assistant, James M. Cattell,
   returned to the US, and Külpe became Wundt’s second assistant,
   working on his own and others’ experiments. During his eight years as
   a research assistant at Wundt’s laboratory, Külpe compiled Principles
   of Physiological Psychology for his mentor.

-  In 1893 he wrote and published the Grundriss der Psychologie
   (`Outlines of
   Psychology <https://archive.org/details/outlinesofpsycho00kluoft/page/n5>`__)
   and dedicated it to his teacher Wundt. The book defined psychology as
   an empirical science that relied on experience and therefore Külpe
   promoted to a professor at Leipzig University.The book soon became a
   classic textbook for the study of psychology, especially experimental
   psychology.

-  In 1894 Külpe moved to the University of Würzburg as a professor of
   philosophy. He founded the Würzburg laboratory shortly after he
   worked at the University of Würzburg. Since then he and his students
   have established the Würzburg School, known as their famous imageless
   thoughts. During his 13 years at Würzburg more than fifty
   experimental investigations were published.

-  Külpe’s 15 years of teaching practice in Würzburg not only
   established his own school of psychology, but also cultivated many
   psychologists. His thoughts even have a great influence on the
   development of Gestalt psychology in the future. The founder of
   Gestalt psychology, `Max
   Wertheimer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer>`__, was his
   student.

-  Külpe left Würzburg in 1909. After three years at the University of
   Bonn, Külpe moved to the University of Munich in 1912. Külpe became a
   professor of philosophy and director of the Institute of Psychology
   at the University of Munich after 1913.

Key Accomplishments & Discoveries
---------------------------------

As a structural psychologist, Oswalkd Külpe published various works on
the topics of logic, aesthetics, philosophy, and epistemology. His first
major book, Grundriss der Psychologie (1893) discussed his research on
reaction time and psychophysics. He defined psychology as “the facts of
experience”. Külpe criticised points made by Carl Stumpf and Hermann
Ebbinghaus. Because of Kulpe’s distinctive views on reaction time and
psychological thinking, Grundriss der Psychologie was translated into
English under the title Outlines of Psychology. In 1912, Kulpe published
On the Modern Psychology of Thinking, primarily focusing on the
importance of thought. Due to his research, Kulpe was able to identify
the need for new definitions for the systematic experimental
introspection.

Contemporary Assessments on Their Work or Discoveries
-----------------------------------------------------

-  Oswald Külpe was the first to perform basic psychological research on
   thinking and problem solving. These ideas inspired later
   psychologists, such as Karl Duncker and Max Wertheimer, who were
   Gestalt psychologists (Markov, 2017). The idea of introspection
   further inspired Sigmund Fraud’s psychoanalysis (Fossa, 2018).

-  One of the accomplishments of Wurzburg School was an emphasis on
   motivation and the role that it plays in the results of the thinking
   process. Motivation is still relevant for psychology today. According
   to the Wurzburg School, motivation affects thinking outcomes as one
   of the variables, and the activity of the ‘id’ relies upon not only
   the subject’s consciousness but also the unconscious determinants
   (Oswald Külpe, n.d.).

-  Külpe’s shift in the late 1890s from Mach’s phenomenalism to realism
   stimulated his interests in the psychology of thinking. However, it
   might have been seen as a deviant move against positivism, which
   dominated the field of psychology and science during that period
   (Lindenfeld, D., 1978).

-  Despite the early success of introspection which was one of the
   accomplishments made by the Wurzburg School, the idea was criticized
   and the Wurzburg School disappeared soon after its main contributors
   had died or separated. Some scholars later reevaluated introspection
   and found that the way the Wurzburgers conducted introspection was in
   fact more of an extended type of third-person observation, not a
   genuine form of first-person research. Moreover, their approach did
   not yield a balanced method for the emergence of third-person
   observation. Introspection as an independent paradigm was thus
   discouraged due to its methodological, biographical, and historical
   aspects (Hackert & Weger, 2018).

-  The concept of reality and introspection proposed by Oswald Külpe
   impacted on the development of contemporary psychology.
   Introspection, which aimed at analyzing the internal processes of
   mental structures and cognitive functioning, led to the development
   of constructivist psychology and their applications to the education.
   In this application, we can assume that human beings actively
   interact with external information and reorganize their own mental
   structures (Fossa, 2018).

-  From 2011 the
   `Oswald-Külpe-Prize <https://www.psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung/forschungspreise/oswald-kuelpe-preis/>`__
   is awarded by the University of Wurzburg to commemorate a person who
   accomplished exceptional scientific contributions to the experimental
   study of higher mental processes (2011).
