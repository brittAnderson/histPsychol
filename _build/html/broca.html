<h1>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a good
understanding of the famous French physician Pierre Paul Broca. Born in
France in the year 1824, Broca made multiple concrete conclusions to his
theories, making him a significant individual in the scientific
community. During his studies, he put a lot of his focus and efforts on
the human brain, considering the fact that he is most well known for
finding Broca’s area and Broca’s aphasia. During his time, Broca was an
intelligent man that succeeded in multiple areas of his work, even
though some of it did take on a racist approach. In this paper, we give
an overview and discuss Broca’s life and work, and the various
accomplishments that he made throughout his career.</p>

<h1>Early Life &amp; Education:<a class="headerlink" href="#early-life-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Pierre Paul Broca was born in a small commune in southwestern France
called Sainte-Foy-la-Grande on June 28, 1824. He suffered a stroke at
the age of 56 and died in Paris on July 9, 1880.</p>
<p>He is most remembered for his contribution to the understanding of the
brain. His study of brain lesions allowed him to discover the area of
the brain connected to speech, which is now known as “Broca’s area”. His
studies also contributed to the understanding of aphasia, and through
his thorough study of aphasic patients he provided the first proof of
the localisation of brain function.</p>
<p>Broca’s studies were encouraged by his family which consisted of his
father, Benjamin Broca, a medical practitioner, and his mother, Annette
Broca, who was known for her sharp intelligence.</p>
<p>He accomplished a basic education in Sainte-Foy-la-Grande, and at his
local university he studied both mathematics and physical science. He
first earned a bachelor’s degree in history and literature and then
moved on to earn a degree in science and mathematics. At the young age
of seventeen he attended medical school in Paris graduating at the early
age of twenty.</p>
<p>While at the university of Paris his mentors included: Philippe Rocord,
Francois Leuret, and Pierre Nicolas Gerdy, which meant that Broca made
the most of his time in medical school by establishing himself in the
scientific world at a young age. The work he did along side these
established scientists opened up many opportunities for Broca, and the
surgeons and anatomists that he worked under helped teach and mentor him
on ways of the scientific world. He was the founder of the Modern
Anthropological School, which aimed to study the history and origins of
man and the different transformations that have taken place throughout
all of the ages and revolutions of our world. After graduating medical
school he moved on to be a professor in the faculty of medicine.</p>
<p>At the age of 24 he began to get recognised for his contribution to the
understanding of the limbic system, and he even started receiving awards
and high positions due to his skills as an anatomist.</p>
<p>In 1868, he became a professor of clinical surgery and was elected as
the chair of Clinical Surgery. He held this position until his death in
1880. While he was the chair of Clinical Surgery, he worked in many
hospitals in Paris, including; St. Antoine, the Pitie, des Cliniques,
and Necker.</p>

<p>Paul Broca’s professional career started when he graduated from medical
school in 1844. He was a scientist with an impressive medical career, a
life-long research experience, significant contributions to
Anthropology, and extraordinary thoughts.</p>
<p>Paul Pierre Broca had multi-internships on urology, dermatology,
psychiatry, anatomy, and surgery. In 1853, he became a professor (Sagan,
1934, pp.6-10) and won the title of the surgeon of the hospitals (Ekbal,
2019, p.89). His contributions to cancer and aneurysm, neuroanatomy,
neurophysiology, neuropathology on the speech center and limbic lobe are
important (Schiller,1979, p.VII). The hands-on learning style of medical
education at that time might have influenced him (Gere, 2013, p.201).
His occupation as a surgeon made his way to autopsy people’s brains who
were suffering from speech disorders.</p>
<p>In terms of his research, his studies were originated from his
involvement in “Society Anatomique de Paris” where he was very
productive. Schiller (as cited in Wikipedia, 2019) stated that he
contributed to understanding muscular disorders in addition to his 250
separate medical contributions (para.19). His research experience
brought him to study Anthropology. In 1859, he founded the Society of
Anthropology (Gere,2013, p.204). Broca (as cited in Wikipedia,2019)
advocated the idea of polygenism which claims that each racial group
comes from a different origin (para.21). Consequently, he had to say
something about hybridity. Broca (as cited in Wikipedia, 2019) concluded
that the result of reproduction between the two groups varies.
Offsprings might be infertile, they may be infertile between themselves
but could be fertile with the parent group, or they might even be
fertile both between themselves and with the parent group,whereas the
reproduction rates are subject to decline until it vanishes. The only
successful variation is known as Eugenesic which is fertile. According
to him, the French were an example of a eugenesic mixed race (para.24).</p>
<p>In the Society of Anthropology, discussions were focused on language,
head shape, and race which would lead the discussions about brain size
and intelligence in 1861(Gere, 2013, p.204). Ashok (as cited in
Wikipedia,2019) stated that Broca thought brain size was not the only
indicator of intelligence. He developed different terminology and
instruments to support his points. For example, “cephalic index shows
the relationship between the brains’ length and width, that was directly
proportional with intelligence”. He concluded that the most intelligent
European group was ‘long-headed’ (para.28).</p>
<p>Broca combined anthropology with medical research and practice,
especially with neurology (Science Museum, para.1). He did not only
study craniology, but wrote five volumes about the relationship between
the size of the skull and intelligence (Gere, 2013, p. 206), Frank said
(as cited in Wikipedia, 2019) he also designed different instruments
such as a stereograph to reach a scientific approach to measure human
physical features (para.27).</p>

<p>His thoughts were parallel with Charles Darwin’s theories. His quote ‘I
would rather be a transformed ape than a degenerate son of Adam’ was a
cause for conflict between him and the church (Wikipedia, para.5). He
was against the slavery and colonization since he thought they would
pose a threat to the native populations (Wikipedia, 2019, para.25). As
Sagan (1934) stated “Broca was a humanist of the nineteenth century, but
unable to shake the consuming prejudices, the human social diseases of
his time. He thought men superior to women, and whites superior to
blacks” (p.11).</p>

<div class="section" id="significant-contributions-discoveries">
<h1>Significant Contributions/Discoveries:<a class="headerlink" href="#significant-contributions-discoveries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Best known for his role in the discovery of particular capacities in the
various parts of the human brain. In 1861, Broca showed that the loss of
capacity for speech was associated with damage to a particular portion
of the brain. This area later became known as Broca’s convolution. His
research also contributed to addressing questions related to the
evolution of human language. Broca has contributed with discovering one
part of the puzzle of the transmission of human culture. There are also
his contributions to the field of physical anthropology. Craniology, or
the scientific measurement of the human skull, was of major importance
at the time, and Broca contributed by inventing roughly twenty seven
different instruments for the measurement of all parts of the human
body, as well as developing and standardizing a multitude of techniques
of measuring. Broca is also credited with the founding of the first
anthropological society in the world, in 1859.</p>

<p>Pierre Paul Broca made many discoveries and large contributions in his
area of work. He is most well known for his work on the human brain. His
most significant contribution is known as “Broca’s area”. “Broca’s area”
is the area within the human brain that is located in the frontal lobe,
responsible for the motion required to produce speech. A person that is
able to understand what others are saying, but has trouble finding words
and actually speaking, is most commonly known to have “Broca’s aphasia”.
He was able to make these discoveries by observing patients who had left
frontal lobe damage, which he saw to be lesioned. Broca’s area has
transformed the way we now understand speech production, language
processing, and the way we comprehend things. Broca’s area has been a
big help to researchers, helping them find causes linked to other speech
disorders that are common in our world today and that are connected to
this area of the brain. These speech disorders include stuttering and
apraxia of speech. Another large discovery of Broca’s that has had a
great impact on the world of science research today are the two famous
institutions that he had founded, which are both located in Paris,
France, and are formally known as the École des Hautes Études and the
Société d’Anthropologie de Paris. The École des Hautes Études is now
known to be one of France’s most prestigious establishments for research
and education, specifically known for teaching neuroscience and
chemistry in the natural science area. The Société d’Anthropologie de
Paris, founded in 1859 by Broca, was a society made up of various
scientists that were the members, where theories and ideas were
discussed and observed. Today it is one of the oldest and still
operating professional anthropological societies in the world, where
they focus on studying the natural history, origins, and biological
diversity of the human species.</p>
<p>Broca may be most well known for his work on the frontal lobe of the
human brain, but that is not all he is known for. His contributions
toward anthropometry are quite notable as well. In this area of his
work, he presented the idea that physical features of the human body
played a large role in predicting intelligence. He had created many
instruments and data points that are now the foundation of methods used
in medical and archeological craniometry. Paul Broca was not only a
great anthropologist, but an amazing neurosurgeon as well, who came up
with many findings and theories that are referred to and used a lot in
our world today. His work on the human brain has become very
influential, and his efforts have opened the path way for many more
great discoveries.</p>
