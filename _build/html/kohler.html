<p>Köhler began his studies at the University of Tübingen in 1905, before
heading to the University of Bonn in 1906, and completing his last few
years of study in the University of Berlin. During his last few years of
education, his work was largely on the connections between physics and
psychology, which he explored with Max Planck and Carl Stumpf. His Ph. D
Thesis was on Acoustic Investigations and addressed certain aspects of
psychoacoustics (the study of sound perception) with Stumpf as his
advisor. After completing his Ph. D, Köhler worked with Max Wertheimer
and Kurt Koffka for 3 years (between 1910-13) and aided Wertheimer in
his studies of apparent movement, which is now referred to as the phi
phenomenon (the illusion of moving stills).</p>
<p>Following this, they created the Gestalt Theory, inspired by the earlier
work of Stumpf and a lecturer by the name of Christian von Ehrenfels.
They later wrote a book called The Task of Gestalt Psychology. In this
book, they explored developments of Gestalt psychology. In the
introduction, Köhler`s displeasure of how his famous quote is
misinterpreted as &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&#8221;
rather then how it was originally spoken as &#8220;The whole is different from
the sum of its parts&#8221;, in which the sum may result in something
completely unrelated to the parts, rather than a simple escalation.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1913, Köhler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife, where he
began working on a book about problem solving and monkeys. The Mentality
of Apes would be published in 1917, cataloging his research on how apes
went about solving problems. His work was the start of insight learning
as well as using chimpanzees for experiments due to the similarities
between them and humans. In his book, he explained why he chose apes as
his test subjects over cats or rats, which were the two other animals
that were currently being tested on, due to the structure of their
brains being similar to human brains. During this experiment, he
gathered most of his observations during the first six months while
working with his assistant. He concluded from the experiments that there
was a correlation between intelligence and brain development.</p>
<p>Köhler was very vocal in the psychological community and took stances
against both introspection and behaviorism. Against introspection (the
self-reporting of conscious thoughts and sensations), he claimed that it
was far too subjective, and did not attempt to properly verify the
conclusions that come from introspection. Against behaviorism (at the
time focused only on what is easily observable and measurable), he
argued that ignoring things like inner thoughts and feelings was
insufficient, and that one could not accurately measure direct
experiences.</p>
<p>In 1920, Köhler returned to Germany and was appointed as the professor
and director of the Psychological Institute at the University of Berlin
where he remained until 1935, after which he left to America as he
refused to abide by the rules that the Nazi party imposed on him. During
his time in Germany, he set up a graduate program in psychology, created
a psychology journal, re-wrote Gestalt Psychology for an American
audience, and helped von Restorff on her work on both the isolation
effect (within many sensations, the odd one out is what you are likely
to remember) and the theory of recall (memory).</p>
<p>He served as a professor for twenty years at Swarthmore College, before
heading to Dartmouth College in 1956, where he was a research professor
as well as the president of the American Psychological Association.
During this time, he lectured freely around the United States, and made
yearly visits to the Free University of Berlin, where he helped
psychologists by keeping them in touch with American psychology and
collaborating in research and encouraging discussion. He died in 1967 in
Enfield, New Hampshire. The Association had planned to give him its gold
medal, but he unfortunately passed away before he could receive that
honor. The Leipzig Zoo established the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research
Center in his name.</p>

</div>
<p>Wolfgang Köhler was a German psychologist who would become one of the
leaders in the development of Gestalt psychology. He was born into a
German family on the 21st of January 1887 in Reval Estonia. His parents
moved the family to Germany where his father was a schoolmaster when he
was six years old. Kohler was married twice and had four children and
died in New Hampshire on the 11th June 1967. He taught at the university
of Frankfurt and amongst many of his accomplishments was his work
published on the mentality of apes in 1917.</p>
<p>In 1909 Köhler earned his PhD and worked at the psychological institute
of Frankfurt-am-Main where he came to know Max Wertheimer and Kurt
Koffka, with whom he formed a life-long friendship and a fateful
intellectual companionship. Together the three of them were able to set
up the foundation for Gestalt psychology. The word Gestalt means the
“unified or meaningful whole”.</p>
<p>Another contribution Köhler is famous for is insight learning. Wolfgang
believed that learning could occur when we gain insight to an entire
situation rather than focusing primarily on the individual parts, which
can be interpreted as stepping back and looking at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Before Wolfgang came along Edward Thorndike controlled the dominant
views on learning. Thorndike believed that animals learned by a means of
rewards and punishments. Kohler sought out to test his theory through
experimentations with chimps. His studies suggested that through insight
learning animals were able to grasp key learning concepts. Kohler had
several of his own ideas at the time. He was able to extend the gestalt
ideas into new experimental areas in memory and perception.</p>

<h1>Gestalt Psychology and Fight Against the Nazis<a class="headerlink" href="#gestalt-psychology-and-fight-against-the-nazis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wolfgang Köhler contributed greatly to not only developing Gestalt
psychology, but also through his social work against Nazis in Germany
throughout his life.</p>
<p>While you may know the phrase “<em>the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts</em>”, it had actually been mistranslated. The actual quote by
Kurt Koffka was that “<em>the whole is **other*</em> than the sum of its
parts*” and was used to describe the field of Gestalt psychology
(Dewey, n.d.). Wolfgang Köhler, along with Max Wertheimer and Kurt
Koffka were critical towards the foundation of Gestalt psychology as
well as the research that followed. Work towards Gestalt psychology
first began in the early 20th century when Wertheimer completed
experiments regarding apparent motion and perception. He found that when
he placed the apparent movement of an object and the real movement of
the object beside it, subjects were unable to distinguish the difference
between the two.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id11">
<img alt="Phi Phenomenon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Phi_Phenomenon.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Phi Phenomenon</span></p>
</div>
<p>This intrigued Wertheimer greatly and inspired him to continue his
investigations on the topic and to start the beginning of Gestalt
psychology. In German, the word “gestalt” can be translated to “form” or
“shape”. It is based on the premise that while our sensory experiences
can be broken down into individual parts, it is the relationship of
these parts as a whole that we actually perceive (Boeree, n.d.). A
common example is given in terms of music. Consider the video below.
While a song may be made up of individual notes, it is their combination
that we perceive as the melody. When Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star is played in different keys the notes that make up the melody change, but we still continue to recognize the same whole (melody) despite a complete difference in its parts (actual tones).</p>

popular subject at the time, which believed that the conscious
experience could be broken down into basic conscious elements. The work
towards Gestalt psychology was largely founded on Carl Stumpf and Clerk
Maxwell’s work in physics. Köhler found that many phenomenon in physics
supported the ideas of gestalt psychology and seemed to “justify” their
work (Köhler, 1959). Additionally, further investigations by Koffka,
Wertheimer and Köhler allowed them to develop the theoretical framework
behind Gestalt psychology known as the Principles of Grouping. Examples
of the Gestalt Principles can be seen in the following

Psychology</em> by Todd Daniel provides greater detail about the principles and also
theory regarding how Gestalt Psychology came to be (around 00:08:35).</p>
<p>After lecturing at various American universities during the mid 1920s,
Köhler was inspired to write the novel “Gestalt Psychology” (Henle,
2000). This novel was critical towards giving English speakers more
information regarding Gestalt Psychology, but also provided criticisms
to topics in psychology that are still relevant today (Henle, 2000).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xnli9hz.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Köhler also contributed greatly to protesting against the Nazi
authorities during his time at the Psychological Institute of the
University of Berlin. When Karl Planck and various other Jew professors
were dismissed from their jobs at Universities in Germany, Köhler wrote
an article titled “Conversations in Germany” against the Nazis. Although
Köhler expected to be arrested, the Nazis didn’t come, but letters from
various strangers applauding Köhler’s courageous stand did. One letter
from a German Jew proclaimed that “[they were] deeply motivated by [the
article] and tears came to [their] eyes.” (Henle, 1978). Furthermore,
when the government decreed that professors must open their lectures
with the Nazi salute, Köhler gave a mocking salute and stated that he
“[did] not share the ideology which it usually signifies or used to
signify.” (Henle, 1979). In addition to this, Wolfgang Köhler protested
several times against unannounced raids during his seminars and
requested for the reinstatement of his assistant. When his requests
failed, Köhler resigned from the Berlin Institute and moved to the US
for a new job at Swarthmore College.</p>

</div>
<p>Wolfgang Köhler played a significant role in the foundation of Gestalt
psychology which is still used as the basis for research in sense and
perception today. Furthermore, he fought against anti-semitism and
proved to be an inspirational figure for both Jews and Non-Jews during
that time of conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="famous-experiments">
<h1>Famous Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#famous-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Kohler’s most famous experiment was one in which he studied insight
learning in Apes. He completed these experiments during his time on the
Island of Tenerife on the Canary Islands during World War One. This
experiment took place within a large room containing bamboo poles and
crates. He began by hanging a banana from a string to the ceiling and
leaving the apes to figure out how to get it down. He noticed that the
apes would jump and attempt to grab it and once they figured out they
couldn’t get it that way, they would sit down for a while and ponder.
After a while they would suddenly get up and attempt to grab it in a new
way, by either using the crates or the bamboo pole. Some stacked boxes,
and had to figure out how to stack them properly before jumping to grab
it while others would use the bamboo pole to knock the banana down by
throwing the pole at it (Kohler’s Work on Insight Learning, n.d.).</p>
<p>The second half of the experiment involved putting the apes within a
cage, giving them a branch of a tree, and placing the banana outside of
the cage. This involved a similar reaction of attempting to reach them,
discovering it was too far, going to think, and then suddenly snapping
the branch in such a way that it could reach between the bars and extend
their arms to reach the banana. Due to the similar reactions between
Apes, Kohler concluded that they did not experience trial-and-error, but
experienced a flash of insight and would go off of whatever they figured
out until they achieved their goal (Ash, I. K., Jee, B. D., &amp; Wiley, J.,
2012). For Kohler’s translated notes on this experiment click
<a class="reference external" href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/XXXIV/135/369/1053754?redirectedFrom=PDF">here</a>.</p>
<p>Through these experiments he also discovered that the apes had these
flashes of insight at different times and it took some longer than
others to figure out a solution or even realise there was anything to do
in their environment. For example, one of the apes named Sultan figured
it out in the first and second experimental conditions almost
immediately and was very successful, but another ape named Koko took
several weeks to figure out a solution to the first experimental
condition (Insight Learning (Wolfgang Kohler in 1925), 2011, December
6). Prior to his work what we knew about animal learning largely came
from Edward Thorndike and his puzzle box experiments, which largely
believed animals came to specific conclusions by accident and repeated
random actions. Kohler’s ape experiments showed that they can also
experience flashes of insight that lead them to a specific goal when
attempting to figure out a problem.</p>
<p>A fun video about Kohler&#8217;s work:</p>
<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNUIRC1R1I8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>His second most famous experiment included the use of hens and pieces of
paper in shades of grey. He began by placing a lighter and darker piece
of paper down and placing the feed on the darker piece, he continued
this until they began always going to the darker piece before taking out
the lighter paper and adding an ever darker paper (Encyclopedia.com,
n.d.). He found that the hens wouldn’t go to the same circle for the
feed, but most went to the even darker one showing that they only
remembered that feed always went on the darker circle. He repeated this
experiment with chickens and a lighter paper, and again with apes and
lighter paper and found very similar results. This proved to Kohler that
both apes and chickens learned through association to a relationship and
they didn’t learn the specific colour.</p>
<p>From these experiments, Kohler was able to deduce that these animals
learned an association to a relationship rather than just memorising the
specific colour, which went against what behaviourists believed at the
time, and became known as the Gestalt Law of Transposition (Smith,
n.d.).</p>

<h1>Criticisms, Influence, and Importance Today of Wolfgang Kohler and Gestalt Psychology<a class="headerlink" href="#criticisms-influence-and-importance-today-of-wolfgang-kohler-and-gestalt-psychology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Many believe Gestalt Psychology to have died in the 1940&#8217;s and 1950&#8217;s
due to the development of field theory. Field theory was developed by
Kurt Lewin, who was influenced by Gestalt Psychology, and developed the
theory that <em>B = f(P,E)</em>. Lewis&#8217; equation means that &#8220;behavior (B) is a
product of the person (P) in their environment (E)&#8221; (Pelletier 2015).
Gestalt psychology also died off due to the emergence of cognitive
science and neuroscience in the 1970s. In 1965, Köhler had been working
on an electric field theory seperate of Lewin&#8217;s, and it had been heavily
criticized by his peers, who rejected it of any significance, thus
rendering Köhler&#8217;s ideas as dead. Köhler and Gestalt psychology were
heavily criticized on their methodology towards their experiments.
According to the critics, their methodology consisted of demonstrations
with too simple stimuli, creating laws without careful consideration and
precision, and finally for having no causal explanation to these
phenomena (Wagemans et al. 2012). However, Gestalt psychology still
remained prominent in experimentation by later psychologists, mostly
regarding research into visual perception and information processing.
Recent research has addressed the methodological problems that Gestalt
psychology was criticized of, and has made an attempt to solve them. For

<p>Köhler and gestalt psychology&#8217;s influence has reached past the domain of
psychology and into other fields, such as the philosophy of French
phenomenologist Maurice Merlau-Ponty. Merlau-Ponty was interested in
perception, and was attempting to redefine the way humans perceive in a
way separate from Kantian beliefs and influences. In doing so, he used
the research and psychological findings of Gestalt psychology to shape
his phenomenology of perception. In particular, Merlau-Ponty referred to
the “nervous system as a field of forces”, which was inspired by
Köhler&#8217;s field theory (Toadvine 2018). Furthermore, Merlau-Ponty used
Köhler&#8217;s experiments on chimpanzees to claim that a humans orientation
towards objectivity is on a level of symbolic behavior, exclusive to
humans. While other animals orient themselves towards things in a
functional behavior, a humans symbolic behavior allows them to “orient
themselves towards objectivity, truth, creativity, and freedom from
biological determined norms”(Toadvine 2018).</p>
