<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Born in 1871, Margaret Floy Washburn was a leading female psychologist
in the 20th century. She was the first female psychologist to receive a
PhD in Psychology from Cornell University, later becoming the second
woman president of the American Psychological Association in 1922. While
she is known for translating the work of Wilhelm Wundt (Ethical Systems)
into English, she has done intense study and work into animal
psychology, going on to publish the book The Animal Mind, in which
established an important role in psychology as it established the field
of animal psychology as a field of study. Across her career, she focused
on the study of comparative psychology, consciousness, animal cognition
and motor skills.</p>

<h2>Early Life:<a class="headerlink" href="#early-life" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Margaret Floy Washburn was born on July 25th, 1871 in New York City,
growing up in Harlem as the only child to Francis, a priest, and
Elizabeth Floy. Though her family background consisted of mostly Dutch
and English, all her family had come to America by the year 1720. She is
noted to spend the majority of her time reading, even long before her
schooling began at age seven, preparing her well for her education and
led to her quick advancement through school.</p>
<p>At age eleven, she began public school and at age fifteen she graduated
from high school. In 1886, the same year she graduated, she began
studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York as a preparatory
student and soon after her undergraduate years, came to find herself
with a strong interest in philosophy through poetry and later finding
herself later developing this interest into an interest in the field of
psychology.</p>

<h2>Education:<a class="headerlink" href="#education" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Margaret’s education really began at home, where she learned to read at
an early age [6]. It was not until she was 7 years old that she entered
the private school system, where she excelled [6]. After about a year
and a half, Margaret’s father enrolled her in a school which was
structured as a public school, where she spent most of her time writing
stories [6]. Margaret’s time in public school proved to be a short one,
as she entered highschool at the age of 12. In 1886, only three years
later, 15 year old Washburn graduated and moved on from high school [1].
Later that year she was enrolled in Vassar College [1], Poughkeepsie.
Although her studies were intensely focused on the sciences, she
continued to indulge her love of literature during her spare time.</p>
<p>It was during her first year of study at Vassar that she developed an
interest in Psychology and Philosophy, and by her senior year they were
cemented as her main areas of study. In 1891, Margaret graduated from
Vassar College at age 20 and went to study under the teachings of James
Mckeen Cattell at Columbia at their psychological laboratory.
Unfortunately, Columbia was not the most receptive College when it came
to female students, and so she was only allowed to audit classes there
[1]. Cattell treated her as he would any of his male students and later
became her mentor.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cattell suggested that Margaret leave Columbia to pursue
further studies elsewhere. Taking his advice, Margaret enrolled at
Cornell University, which had granted her a scholarship [6], to study at
the Sage School of Philosophy. Here, she became Edward Titchener’s first
graduate student, and would later report that at first “he did not quite
know what to do with” her [1]. But it all worked out, as in 1894
Washburn became the first woman to be granted a PhD in Psychology and
her doctorate dissertation was later published by Wilhelm Wundt [3].</p>

<section id="professional-activities">
<h2>Professional Activities:<a class="headerlink" href="#professional-activities" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Margaret Floy Washburn had quite a few professional activities, not
limited to participation in various academic societies, field-related
organizations, and academic associations [5]. Upon obtaining her
Philosophy and Psychology Ph.D. from the University of Cornell in 1984
[1], she relocated for the next 6 years to Wells College, where she was
crowned the Chair of Psychology, Philosophy, Logic and Ethics [5]. In
1985, Wundt honorably approved Washburn’s meticulously lab-researched
dissertation, on how distances and directions on skin are visually
understood, with its focus on the influence the role of vision has on
these variables [5]. In 1902, Washburn became the head-psychology
assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, and akin in 1903 at
her ‘alma mater’, Vassar College, settling here until her death [5].</p>
<p>She was an extremely thorough but crystal-clear professor of animal and
social psychology, a University of Cornell warden and a scientist, who
left her mark on her students and close psychologists and faculty [5].
While practicing at Vassar College, Washburn implemented what we now
know as Co-Op with her upper-year students, giving them the reward of
having their solutions integrated with her work, in the school’s
‘Laboratory Section’ of the American Journal of Psychology, thus
allowing the students to leave their significant imprint on the
scientific community [5]. Some of her lab. topics analyzed include:
‘Memory of Hand and Diverse Spatial Locomotion’ [10], ‘3D Apprehension
by the Eye’, ‘Experimental Esthetics’ and ‘Issues in Animal Psychology;
Relating the Entire Human to the Notion of Possible Animal
Consciousness’ [5].</p>
<p>M. F. Washburn had worked more than 25 years in developing some of her
smaller laboratory experiments, for example, the ‘Memory of Hand and
Diverse Spacial Locomotion’ as referenced by York University’s
Christopher D. Green (2000, April) in <a class="reference external" href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Washburn/murchison.htm">Classics in the History of
Psychology</a>
[10]. In this experiment, Washburn discovered that part of our primal
front cortex, the left side of the primary cortex which controls the
right side of the body,[9] the part of the brain that deals with spatial
movement, can better recall movements of the left hand, rather than
those of the right hand. This is highly likely due to more
automatization, or subconscious level movement of the left hand in the
brain [9]. Washburn found out that it was puzzling how one can feel or
decipher muscle movement in the skin of the hand, when the direction of
the movement cannot be figured out [10].</p>
<p>In 1908, Washburn published her first book ‘Animal Mind’ which
encompassed both the idea of animal consciousness and animal behavior
and was frequently edited, to include new points of view and ideas, such
as the popular 1912 concept of ‘behaviorism’ [5]. Washburn was President
of the American Psychological Association (and of its New York
location), and Vice-President and Chairman of Psychology at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science [5]. Twice, during the late
1910’s and late 1930’s, Washburn was on the Division of Anthropology and
Psychology of the National Research Council, even as Chairman [5].</p>
<p>She was a 30-year working member of the National Academy of Sciences,
un-discriminatory in her research collaborations [5]. A valuable
contribution, Washburn installed the National Research Council’s
‘Psychological Abstracts’ journal and edited the American Journal of
Psychology for a cumulative period of 36 years [5]. In 1927, she
received a commemorative Vol. of the journal [5]. Her most developed,
thorough theory is the ‘Motor Theory of Ideas and Perceptions’ [5]. A
more detailed account of her professional activities can be found at

<section id="key-accomplishments">
<h2>Key Accomplishments:<a class="headerlink" href="#key-accomplishments" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a woman of science in the 1900s, Margaret Washburn contributed a lot
to the field of psychology. She wrote many publications including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/09/animal-mind.aspx">The
Animal Mind</a>.
She was the first female to receive a PhD. The fact that she became a
respected psychologist in a field dominated by men is an accomplishment
in and of itself.</p>
<p>While being a professor with a PhD is always a great accomplishment,
Washburn became one during times where women were discouraged from such
occupations. For most of her career she taught at Vassar College [1].
Not only did she become one, she was also very respected amongst her
students. Something that made her such a good professor during her time
at Vassar College, was that she allowed her students to take part in her
research. Like a co-op program, she would choose major students to help
her with an experiment that she was working. She would do some of the
heavy lifting, but she gave them the opportunity to take part in the
process, namely running the experiments and calculating the results [5].
This experience allowed her students to gain hands-on exposure in the
field of psychology. To be a female professor during her time was a
great accomplishment, but the fact that she was able to implement new
strategies to help her students is another huge accomplishment .</p>
<p>Margaret Washburn’s publications helped to change and evolve psychology
into what it is today. One of her more well known publications was her
book The Animal Mind. The publishing of this book allowed for a new
avenue of psychology, animal psychology, to be formed. The book was also
very popular, as she wrote three other editions after the original. This
book also was different in the fact that Washburn had used the
experimental method to help support her research [4]. This was notable
since behaviourism was a popular way of thinking amongst psychologists,
and Washburn turned away from this way of thinking. In the book she
stated that the origin of consciousness in the animal world is unknown.
This book allowed psychologists at the time to view topics in a
different perspective [5].</p>
<p>Another accomplishment of Margaret Washburn was how she blazed a path
for the future for females in the field of psychology and science as a
whole. She was the president of the American Psychological Association,
marking only the second time a woman had received that honour. As well,
she was named, a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, in which
she was also only the second woman at the time to receive that
distinction [3].</p>
</section>
<section id="discoveries">
<h2>Discoveries:<a class="headerlink" href="#discoveries" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>She made 4 significant contributions to psychology—the problems of
social consciousness, the problems of revived and ideated emotions, the
role of movement in the development of mental life, and the field of
animal psychology.</p>
<p>Washburn pointed out that social activity precedes social consciousness
and that the animal responds to the behavior of other animals rather
than to any idea of their mental states. Later, psychologists began to
conceive of the social behavior of man as a reaction to the behavior of
others. Miss Washburn later falsified this claim.</p>
<p>Her interest was in seeking to learn something about the subjective
experience of animals, everything that ranged from their sensations to
their ability to form associations. She tried to bridge by imagination
the gap between human consciousness and that of animals whose differing
anatomical structure would prevent them from having the same sensations
as people. The Animal Mind brought forth a flood of experimental
evidence for these positions.</p>
<p>She also studied the affective value of articulate sounds. She suggested
as a measure of affective sensitiveness (that is, the tendency to be
strongly affected both in the direction of pleasantness and in that of
unpleasantness) the ratio of the sum of the number of judgments of
extreme pleasantness and extreme unpleasantness to the number of
judgments of indifference. She tried this method out on ‘poets’ and
‘scientists. The ‘poets,’ as might be expected, showed higher affective
sensitiveness than the ‘scientists,’indicating that her technique of
measurement might have practical value in investigating an individual’s
bent.

<section id="contemporary-assessments-on-their-work">
<h2>Contemporary Assessments on Their Work:<a class="headerlink" href="#contemporary-assessments-on-their-work" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Washburn’s The Animal Mind is one of her most significant works, in
which she argued that animals’ mental states should be studied alongside
their behavior, and outlined these arguments in her book. The Animal
Mind established an important role in psychology as it established the
field of animal psychology as a field of study. Moreover, later editions
of The Animal Mind were the standard textbook of comparative psychology
for nearly 25 years.</p>
<p>Her book outlined numerous experiments in animal psychology, including
the consciousness and behavior of over 100 different animal species,
compared to her contemporaries who primarily focused on rodents. As a
result, she strongly influenced comparative psychology from The Animal
Mind. She also developed a motor theory of cognition, suggesting that
the body’s movements had an influence on thought, of which she wrote
about in her second book Movement and Mental Imagery, published in 1916.
Psychologist E.G. Boring (1929) recognized Washburn’s important role in
establishing animal psychology, as The Animal Mind provided a concise
collection that marked the growth for this new scientific field of
research [4]. Additionally, other contemporaries that researched animal
psychology, such as Donald Griffin (1990) and Marian Dawkins (1993),
make references and come to similar conclusions made in The Animal Mind.
