## Abstract
Born in 1871, Margaret Floy Washburn was a leading female psychologist in the 20th century. She was the first female psychologist to receive a PhD in Psychology from Cornell University, later becoming the second woman president of the American Psychological Association in 1922. While she is known for translating the work of Wilhelm Wundt (Ethical Systems) into English, she has done intense study and work into animal psychology, going on to publish the book The Animal Mind, in which established an important role in psychology as it established the field of animal psychology as a field of study. Across her career, she focused on the study of comparative psychology, consciousness, animal cognition and motor skills. 


Biography 
========
## Early Life: 
Margaret Floy Washburn was born on July 25th, 1871 in New York City, growing up in Harlem as the only child to Francis, a priest, and Elizabeth Floy. Though her family background consisted of mostly Dutch and English, all her family had come to America by the year 1720. She is noted to spend the majority of her time reading, even long before her schooling began at age seven, preparing her well for her education and led to her quick advancement through school.


 At age eleven, she began public school and at age fifteen she graduated from high school. In 1886, the same year she graduated, she began studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York as a preparatory student and soon after her undergraduate years, came to find herself with a strong interest in philosophy through poetry and later finding herself later developing this interest into an interest in the field of psychology.

## Education:
Margaret’s education really began at home, where she learned to read at an early age [6]. It was not until she was 7 years old that she entered the private school system, where she excelled [6]. After about a year and a half, Margaret’s father enrolled her in a school which was structured as a public school, where she spent most of her time writing stories [6].  Margaret’s time in public school proved to be a short one, as she entered highschool at the age of 12. In 1886, only three years later, 15 year old Washburn graduated and moved  on from high school [1]. Later that year she was enrolled in Vassar College [1], Poughkeepsie. Although her studies were intensely focused on the sciences, she continued to indulge her love of literature during her spare time. 


 It was during her first year of study at Vassar that she developed an interest in Psychology and Philosophy, and by her senior year they were cemented as her main areas of study. In 1891, Margaret graduated from Vassar College at age 20 and went to study under the teachings of James Mckeen Cattell at Columbia at their psychological laboratory. Unfortunately, Columbia was not the most receptive College when it came to female students, and so she was only allowed to audit classes there [1]. Cattell treated her as he would any of his male students and later became her mentor. 


Eventually, Cattell suggested that Margaret leave Columbia to pursue further studies elsewhere. Taking his advice, Margaret enrolled at Cornell University, which had granted her a scholarship [6], to study at the Sage School of Philosophy. Here, she became Edward Titchener’s first graduate student, and would later report that at first “he did not quite know what to do with” her [1]. But it all worked out, as in 1894 Washburn became the first woman to be granted a PhD in Psychology and her doctorate dissertation was later published by Wilhelm Wundt [3].

Significant Research Contributions
==========================
## Professional Activities:
Margaret Floy Washburn had quite a few professional activities, not limited to participation in various academic societies, field-related organizations, and academic associations [5]. Upon obtaining her Philosophy and Psychology Ph.D. from the University of Cornell in 1984 [1], she relocated for the next 6 years to Wells College, where she was crowned the Chair of Psychology, Philosophy, Logic and Ethics [5]. In 1985, Wundt honorably approved Washburn's meticulously lab-researched dissertation, on how distances and directions on skin are visually understood, with its focus on the influence the role of vision has on these variables [5]. In 1902, Washburn became the head-psychology assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, and akin in 1903 at her 'alma mater', Vassar College, settling here until her death [5]. 


She was an extremely thorough but crystal-clear professor of animal and social psychology, a University of Cornell warden and a scientist, who left her mark on her students and close psychologists and faculty [5]. While practicing at Vassar College, Washburn implemented what we now know as Co-Op with her upper-year students, giving them the reward of having their solutions integrated with her work, in the school's 'Laboratory Section' of the American Journal of Psychology, thus allowing the students to leave their significant imprint on the scientific community [5]. Some of her lab. topics analyzed include: 'Memory of Hand and Diverse Spatial Locomotion' [10], '3D Apprehension by the Eye', 'Experimental Esthetics' and 'Issues in Animal Psychology; Relating the Entire Human to the Notion of Possible Animal Consciousness' [5]. 


M. F. Washburn had worked more than 25 years in developing some of her smaller laboratory experiments, for example, the ‘Memory of Hand and Diverse Spacial Locomotion’ as referenced by York University’s Christopher D. Green (2000, April) in [Classics in the History of Psychology](https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Washburn/murchison.htm) [10]. In this experiment, Washburn discovered that part of our primal front cortex, the left side of the primary cortex which controls the right side of the body,[9] the part of the brain that deals with spatial movement, can better recall movements of the left hand, rather than those of the right hand. This is highly likely due to more automatization, or subconscious level movement of the left hand in the brain [9]. Washburn found out that it was puzzling how one can feel or decipher muscle movement in the skin of the hand, when the direction of the movement cannot be figured out [10].


 In 1908, Washburn published her first book 'Animal Mind' which encompassed both the idea of animal consciousness and animal behavior and was frequently edited, to include new points of view and ideas, such as the popular 1912 concept of 'behaviorism' [5]. Washburn was President of the American Psychological Association (and of its New York location), and Vice-President and Chairman of Psychology at the American Association for the Advancement of Science [5]. Twice, during the late 1910's and late 1930's, Washburn was on the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council, even as Chairman [5]. 


She was a 30-year working member of the National Academy of Sciences, un-discriminatory in her research collaborations [5]. A valuable contribution, Washburn installed the National Research Council's 'Psychological Abstracts' journal and edited the American Journal of Psychology for a cumulative period of 36 years [5]. In 1927, she received a commemorative Vol. of the journal [5]. Her most developed, thorough theory is the 'Motor Theory of Ideas and Perceptions' [5]. A more detailed account of her professional activities can be found at [Nasonline.org](http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/washburn-margaret.pdf) [5], short for National Academy of Sciences, under biographical memoirs, under the .pdf journal name of ‘National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Biographical Memoirs, Volume XXV Twelfth Memoir: Biographical Memoir of Margaret Floy Washburn 1871-1939’ by Robert S. Woodworth, presented to the Academy at the Autumn Meeting, 1948.


## Key Accomplishments:
For a woman of science in the 1900s, Margaret Washburn contributed a lot to the field of psychology. She wrote many publications including [The Animal Mind](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/09/animal-mind.aspx). She was the first female to receive a PhD. The fact that she became a respected psychologist in a field dominated by men is an accomplishment in and of itself.
 
While being a professor with a PhD is always a great accomplishment, Washburn became one during times where women were discouraged from such occupations.  For most of her career she taught at Vassar College [1]. Not only did she become one, she was also very respected amongst her students. Something that made her such a good professor during her time at Vassar College, was that she allowed her students to take part in her research. Like a co-op program, she would choose major students to help her with an experiment that she was working. She would do some of the heavy lifting, but she gave them the opportunity to take part in the process, namely running the experiments and calculating the results [5]. This experience allowed her students to gain hands-on exposure in the field of psychology. To be a female professor during her time was a great accomplishment, but the fact that she was able to implement new strategies to help her students is another huge accomplishment .


Margaret Washburn’s publications helped to change and evolve psychology into what it is today. One of her more well known publications was her book The Animal Mind. The publishing of this book allowed for a new avenue of psychology, animal psychology, to be formed. The book was also very popular, as she wrote three other editions after the original. This book also was different in the fact that Washburn had used the experimental method to help support her research [4]. This was notable since behaviourism was a popular way of thinking amongst psychologists, and Washburn turned away from this way of thinking. In the book she stated that the origin of consciousness in the animal world is unknown. This book allowed psychologists at the time to view topics in a different perspective [5].


Another accomplishment of Margaret Washburn was how she blazed a path for the future for females in the field of psychology and science as a whole. She was the president of the American Psychological Association, marking only the second time a woman had received that honour. As well, she was named, a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, in which she was also only the second woman at the time to receive that distinction [3].


## Discoveries:


She made 4 significant contributions to psychology—the problems of social consciousness, the problems of revived and ideated emotions, the role of movement in the development of mental life, and the field of animal psychology.


Washburn pointed out that social activity precedes social consciousness and that the animal responds to the behavior of other animals rather than to any idea of their mental states. Later, psychologists began to conceive of the social behavior of man as a reaction to the behavior of others. Miss Washburn later falsified this claim. 


Her interest was in seeking to learn something about the subjective experience of animals, everything that ranged from their sensations to their ability to form associations. She tried to bridge by imagination the gap between human consciousness and that of animals whose differing anatomical structure would prevent them from having the same sensations as people. The Animal Mind brought forth a flood of experimental evidence for these positions.


She also studied the affective value of articulate sounds. She suggested as a measure of affective sensitiveness (that is, the tendency to be strongly affected both in the direction of pleasantness and in that of unpleasantness) the ratio of the sum of the number of judgments of extreme pleasantness and extreme unpleasantness to the number of judgments of indifference. She tried this method out on 'poets' and 'scientists. The 'poets,' as might be expected, showed higher affective sensitiveness than the 'scientists,'indicating that her technique of measurement might have practical value in investigating an individual's bent.

## Contemporary Assessments on Their Work:
Washburn’s The Animal Mind is one of her most significant works, in which she argued that animals' mental states should be studied alongside their behavior, and outlined these arguments in her book. The Animal Mind established an important role in psychology as it established the field of animal psychology as a field of study. Moreover, later editions of The Animal Mind were the standard textbook of comparative psychology for nearly 25 years. 


Her book outlined numerous experiments in animal psychology, including the consciousness and behavior of over 100 different animal species, compared to her contemporaries who primarily focused on rodents. As a result, she strongly influenced comparative psychology from The Animal Mind. She also developed a motor theory of cognition, suggesting that the body's movements had an influence on thought, of which she wrote about in her second book Movement and Mental Imagery, published in 1916. Psychologist E.G. Boring (1929) recognized Washburn’s important role in establishing animal psychology, as The Animal Mind provided a concise collection that marked the growth for this new scientific field of research [4]. Additionally, other contemporaries that researched animal psychology, such as Donald Griffin (1990) and Marian Dawkins (1993), make references and come to similar conclusions made in The Animal Mind.
