1 More than just Wundt
======================

  Any date for the founding of experimental psychology will be
  arbitrary. Selecting 1879 as the founding of the experimental
  psychology laboratory at Leipizig emphasizes the introduction of
  experimental tools, procedures, and an emphasis on testable theories
  to the growing tradition of empirical thinking in mental and moral
  philosophy. Similarly arbitrary is the annointing of one man as a
  founder of experimental psychology. By naming Wilhelm Wundt to this
  role we commemorate the founding of a laboratory psychology, but we
  also emphasize a man who is known more for bureaucratic success than
  scientific achievement. Many of the domains of psychology that are
  dear to modern minds are ones that Wundt closed off as beyond
  scientific approach. Memory assessements relying on words, poems, or
  pictures were too contaminated by learned associations to be
  effective, pure probes of conscious experience. A reliance on reaction
  time showed the usefulness of new measurement devices, but Wundt was
  not a keen experimentalist and was not innovative in new tools for
  measurement or for expanding the domain of psychological study. And as
  another consequence of his emphasis on a pure, near simultaneous,
  report of conscious experience the entire domain of thought and
  reasoning was beyond approach. For the same reason, experimental
  subjects should be trained in introspection, but not in the content
  about which they are introspecting, e.g. music. To study musical
  perception required, according to Wundt, introspectors who were
  musically naive. Wundt carried strong theoretical prejudices, which
  often determined his scientific positions more than empircial
  evidence. Convinced of the primacy of visual experience and images
  Wundt labeled any evidence at variance with this idea to be
  axiomatically the product of bad experimental technique.

  It is clear then that by elevating Wundt to the role of founder of the
  field, we are giving priority to one aspect of our science: its
  development as an experimental discipline; but ignoring many other
  aspects of its early development as a science. Through the examples of
  some of Wundt's contemporaries we can see how early scientific
  psychology was enriched by additional approaches and different
  strengths. In this chapter four of these early German contemporaries
  are highlighted.

  Ebbinghaus Memory Method

  - ton

  - lut

  - zeg

  - kac

  - gom

  - biv

  - gud

  - dar

  - rul

  Ebb Meth Comments His method was a real tour de force of insight and
  effort. He conceived that by using nonsense syllables he would be able
  to remove the effects of association, but that he would still be able
  to apply something like the methods he had read about in Fechner's
  book. He wrote out all these items on cards. He used a metronome to
  present them at a controlled rate. He could draw from the box of cards
  to get a random sample. He had only one subject, himself. He tried to
  control all aspects of his life to make himself consistent in testing.
  This led to his discovering the primacy effect, recency effect, the
  span of memory and forgetting rates. Also demonstrated something
  called the savings rate. You memorize a list and later on you see how
  many trials it takes you to relearn the list. The decrease in the
  number of trials is the savings. The change in savings rate over time
  gave him a measure to use for determining how fast a memory trace is
  weakening. Otherwise, you only have a measure of what you know and
  what you don't. So you can see the combination of sheer hard work with
  really innovative methods.

1.1.1 Philip Boswood Ballard
----------------------------

  Interesting tidbit mentioned by Thom Carr on a visit to Waterloo in
  March 2017. Studied memory using poetry, and concluded that it could
  get better after a gap. Here is the work:

  Of course it could well be stochastic. But I should look at this at
  some point.
