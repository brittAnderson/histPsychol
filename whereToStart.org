* Where to begin?
  
The questions which motivate many to study psychology are ancient. Thus one could easily justify starting with the Greeks: Plato, Aristotle, and many less well known thinkers who had views on consciousness, perception, memory, and emotions --- all topics of contemporary interest [fn:earlyPhilosophy]. And while that choice would lead to interesting discussions and readings, and while it would give rise to an informed context for modern debates, it would not advance those debates. The same questions reappear across the centuries, are not resolved, and leave little sense of progress. One should look closer to modern times to frame the stage for scientific psychology's origin.

But one should not leap too far. Jumping all the way to Wilhelm Wundt and [[http://psychologie.biphaps.uni-leipzig.de/hist.html][1879]], the year that is commonly used to mark the founding of Experimental Psychology, would omit a statement of the problem that a /scientific/ psychology was meant to solve. Psychology emerges from philosophy, both abstractly, the contents of the inquiry, and concretely, from its people and departments. Why? What was wrong with the contemporary state of the art that demanded new methods? In fact, demanded a new [[https://archive.org/stream/grundzgederphys15wundgoog#page/n22/mode/1up][science]]? One that connected the knowledge, procedure and rigor of physiology, with the bifurcated domain of rationalist and empiricist mental philosophy. 

In looking to the stories of Descartes and Locke we see early statements of the rationalist and empiricist positions. We are greeted by questions, such as the one that was posed by Molyneux, that are still generating modern discussion and research. And by picking this time we enter history when it becomes possible to conceive of science /per se./ Prior to Galileo one could argue there was no science [fn:noScience].

* Philosophers and Psychology

Descartes was a genius and polymath. His inclusion here rests not on the content of his substance dualist claim that mind and matter were two different things, but on the fact that in making this claim he was pulling together the topics of introspective philosophy and physiology. Descartes maintained that matter was physical, and the mind was not. They were two substances (/Res cogitans/ and /Res extensa/) yet they interacted. Mind could influence matter and thus thought could determine behavior. In this rapprochement between brain and spirit Descartes presages the creation of a science of psychology which will take thought and its physical basis as its content. 

Descartes is also relevant for his metaphysics. He famously proposed "[[https://archive.org/stream/discoursdel00desc#page/22/mode/2up/search/"je+pense+donc+je+suis"][/Je pense, donc je suis/]]." I think therefore I am.[fn:cogito] His method of doubt, and the specific conclusions he reached from employing it may be more pertinent to epistemology, but for scientific psychology they demonstrate the critical use of introspection. Descartes imagined some trickster was deluding his senses. What was it he could believe given the risk of this deceiving demon? We have all been deceived by dreams and illusions - at least momentarily. Given that, is it not possible that all is illusion? That all we perceive is false. That all we know is wrong. No, replied Descartes. There is always somthing that thinks, and that is constant in its identity across time. I think. Therfore I am. There can be no doubt of this concludes Descartes (and many others). It is an example of the careful use of one's own internal conscious representations and reasonings as the basis for a scientific claim. This will be the method most central to early scientific psychology, and we can take this example of its early deployment as a herald for the scientific psychology to follow. 

*** Some Biography[fn:descartesBio]

If the above show how the ideas of Descartes, his rationality and his use of instrospection, indicate the science yet to come, we can also see in Descartes' life the practices that would be developed to support all the sciences including psychology. 

He was born the son of a sort of lawyer and regional politician. His mother died within a year of his birth, and Descartes was raised by a grandmother. He was deemed sickly. Possibly tuberculosis, and possibly contracted from his mother. He had two inheritances: one monetary and one his intelligence. The latter seems to have been the way he purchased indulgences. Even at a Jesuit school there was a tolerance for his sleeping in and working in bed. [[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Descartes_schooling.html][Some words by Descartes about his own schooling.]]

He acquired a degree in law in Paris.  Even in those days guardians were interested in making sure that an education provided you a way to make a living, and also in those days young men and women entertained questions about purpose and meaning. Descartes seems to have had his crisis in his early twenties. What good was his knowledge? In his own existential crisis he volunteered for the army [fn:army], and became a mercenary for Holland against Spanish forces in the Thirty Years War. While developing and teaching artillery techniques he still seems to have been indulged in a degree of military tolerance. Because it was at this time that he apparently retired to his oven to meditate and in the course of three vivid dreams developed his mental philosophy.  

Descartes is also the man behind the Cartesian coordinate system. He was an accomplished mathematician and his coordinate system is a small component of the revolution he created by showing the connection between algebra and geometry. Algebra presents math as formulas. Geometry as drawings. Descartes showed how you could move back and forth. Take your compass and draw a circle on the page of radius $r$. That image can also be expressed as a function $x^2 + y^2 = r$. Work in the "domain" that is most convenient and then convert back into the other. Troubled by a geometric problem? Translate it into algebra. Solve the hard part there, and then translate the solution back into geometry. 

These mathematical experiences are key to all scientific inquiry. To study something you must be able to measure it. Mathematizing experience is for Kant the essence of a science, and even if we don't go as far as Kant. We can see the idea of trying to quantify experience as a key feature of the nascent struggles to move psychological investigations beyond its idiosyncratic character. [[http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hop/2/3/163.html][Herbart]] is one of the first to try and give a mathematical tone to [[https://archive.org/details/textbookinpsycho1891herb][psychological theorizing]], and it will be Fechner and then Helmholtz who successfully fuse quantification with measurement to generate theories of thought. In Descartes we see the early development of mathematical ideas as providing a dictionary for translating between scientific domains.

Analytic geometry. Scientific investigation. Extracted ox eye and first to demonstrate the inversion of the retinal image (thinned back).  Was going to publish big work (Le Monde) when school buddy Mersenne wrote about Galileo. Descartes decides to hold off on much and stays in Holland to avoid religious persecution. averages about one address per year for the next twenty years.  Queen Christina calls him, by invitation with a war ship, to come tutor her in Sweden. Lessons in winter at 5 am. Descartes gets pneumonia and dies.  Swedish ambassador cuts off a finger for a souvenir.  Casket sent to small so they separate head from body. Head gets lost for 150 years.  

   He his important to us for several reasons. 
   - his explicit linking of the brain with behavior, and mental life.
   - he shows the connection to philosophical and psychological ideas. He proposes an explicit location for the communication of the mental and physical.
   - he treats the body as a machine
** Q2
*** What does the word Zeitgeist Mean?
(from Wikipedia) The Zeitgeist (spirit of the age or spirit of the time) is the intellectual fashion or dominant school of thought that typifies and influences the culture of a particular period in time. For example, the Zeitgeist of modernism typified and influenced architecture, art, and fashion during much of the 20th century.
The German word Zeitgeist is often attributed to the philosopher Georg Hegel, but he never actually used the word. In his works such as Lectures on the Philosophy of History, he uses the phrase der Geist seiner Zeit (the spirit of his time)—for example, "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."  
** Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709 - 1751)
b. St Malo just like Jacques Cartier.  Physician. Begins the use of observation to inform psychology and argues for the physical nature of thought. Uses his personal clinical experience of a delirium from fever.  Challenged Descartes on separation from animal to man. Offered to turn a gorilla into a little gentleman with time (Savage-Rumbaugh and other monkey ape language studies).  Died of over indulgence (too many truffles). 
** Empiricism
** Q3
*** What is the difference between science and empiricism?
    Contrast the way empirical was used then and how it was not the same as experimental.  Emphasize the contrast to innate knowledge and the conception of a blank slate.  Also the development of association psychology.
** Thomas Hobbes (1588- 1679). 
Most famous for his work Leviathan, on principles of proper government.  Often quoted for his line that there is nothing in the mind of man that was not begotten by the organs of sense.  Acts as a stimulus to Locke.
** Q4 What is the tabula rasa and where does the term originate?
Although the tabula rasa term comes from Aristotle, the notion of a blank slate is established in Locke.  There is NO innate knowledge, not even of God. Everything comes from the senses.  Reflection is the operation of the mind upon the senses. The word is carefully chosen; think of a mirror.  
** Locke (1632 - 1704)
*** Bio
Attends Westminster school, possibly witnesses the beheading of Charles the First.  Goes to Oxford on Scholarship.  Studies medicine. A bit of a dilettante.  More attracted to the practical approach of Thomas Willis than the classical education. British science is going through its own growth at this time with the Royal Society.  He drains Lord Ashley's liver cyst and they become associates.  He works for Lord Ashley.  Writes about government and when Ashley falls from favor joins him in Holland.  Most famous work is an essay concerning human understanding.

*** For Locke there are two sources of knowledge. What are they? 
sensation and reflection
*** What distinguishes a simple idea?
It is irreducible
*** Was Locke a behaviorist?
You could argue that he was. He was familiar with the ideas of reward and punishment. 
** Q5
*** What are some arguments against the blank slate theory of human knowledge (and what is the philosophical term that describes the study of the limits, nature, and origin of human knowledge)?
**** epistemology
** Auguste Comte. 
founder of positivism. Only things that can be known are those which can be observed.  Denies possibility of a scientific psychology because mind cannot observe itself.
** George Berkeley
Irish, wants to found college (Bermuda), Rhode Island, UC school named for him, donates books to Yale and Harvard. Young cocky character. Extreme empiricism. Nothing exists unless it is perceived. Therefore, denies Locke's primary qualities.  Does important work on vision especially that having to do with depth perception, but not clear actually doing anything we would call an experiment.  
** Some discussion of empirical thought
** What is the difference between a primary and a secondary quality?
Primary qualities are those that are inherent in the object itself, such as motion, whereas secondary qualities are those in the observer, such as color.  Simple sensations are indivisible, where as complex sensation are combinations, e.g. the color, feel, appearance and scent of the rose.
** David Hume (1711 - 1776) 
Scottish. goes further than Berkeley to deny that we can even know God or that anything exists. Cause and effect isn't know it is just inferred from experience.  Great emphasis on the association of ideas.  resemblance, contiguity, compare to Aristotle's ideas and, for memory, those of Ebbinghaus when we get there.  
** Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804). 
German, Königsberg.  celibate. never more than 50 km from home. Very regimented life.  Response to radical empiricism. Argues that some things (especially the concepts of space and time) are known a priori.  Only those sciences that can be deduced from a priori concepts and mathematized, like physics, can be real sciences. Therefore psychology cannot, nor can chemistry.  Did admit an informal science. Talked of ``anthropology.'' Thought some things might be done with the intensity of sensations.
** David Hartley.  (1705 - 1757) 
Minister's son.  disagreed with church doctrine on eternal damnation and so decided to become a doctor instead of a minister.  rejected Descartes notion of hollow tubes for vibrating strings.  (what happens when you pluck a string of a guitar?) - what happens if you stare at a candle and close your eyes.  After image demo and discussion.  [[http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32786820s/date1765][D'Arcy]]: hot coal swung in a circle, fuses to a circle, the speed used to estimate neural processing time.  
** Alexander Bain (1818 - 1903) 
poor origins.  works in a Scottish textile mill, but teaches himself Latin and mathematics and escapes the mill to go self supported to college. mostly a writer. founds Mind the first journal devoted to psychology, but primarily philosophical.  Like Hartley he develops a psychology based on physiological principles.  Observations of new born lambs random motions to locate the teat for suckling.  

** Questions
*** Make a case for which of these we should call the first psychologist.
*** What did Locke believe to be the source of all knowledge?
**** sensation and reflection --- what is the difference?
 Notice that Locke distinguished sensation and reflection by reference to their objects. We acquire ideas of sensation through the causal operation of external objects on our sensory organs, and ideas of reflection through the "internal Sense" that is awareness of our own intellectual operations. As the rest of Book II is designed to show, these two sources provide us with all of the ideas we can ever have. [Essay II i 3-5] 
*** How did Locke's ideas contrast with those of Descartes' concerning the source or origin of human knowledge?
**** Locke believe we learned EVERYTHING through experience. Descartes was a rationalist. At the base, all knowledge grew out of a fundamental, inherent, truth. The source of all knowledge was not experience, but human rationality and thought. Je pense donc Je suis.
*** Why is the work of /empirical philosophy/ relevant for the development of scientific psychology?
 - empiricism emphasized /mental/ constructs
 - it related physical experiences to mental content
*** What was the date and author of the first North American textbook of Psychology?
 - 1827

*** [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/][Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is one of the most famous philosophers of the 20th century. 
**** What form of philosophy is he most strongly associated with?
***** Analytical philosophy
**** What is the only "psychology" book that he kept upon his shelves?
***** [[http://www.jstor.org/stable/27744632?seq%3D1][What Wittgenstein Learned from William James]]

* Footnotes

[fn:army] [[http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm][Wittgenstein too volunteered for the army]]. What is it with famous philosophers and enlistment? This same [[http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-descartes.htm][website]] has a nice article about Descartes military experience.
[fn:earlyPhilosophy] Two textbooks that give reasonably extended treatments of these ancient sources are [[http://www.alibris.com/The-Great-Psychologists-A-History-of-Psychological-Thought-Robert-Irving-Watson/book/23787480?matches=16][The Great Psychologists]] by Robert I. Watson (which can be found very cheaply on line), and [[http://www.amazon.com/Connections-History-Systems-Psychology-Michael/dp/0618415122][Connections in the History and Systems of Psychology]] by B. Michael Thorne and Tracy B. Henley, which is newer, but more expensive. 
[fn:noScience] A useful question to consider at this stage is whether or not you agree with this statement: Before Galileo there was nothing /we/ would call a science. To have an opinion on that you will not only need to know a little bit more about Galileo and what it was he did, but also what is meant by the word science. What makes something justifiably called "a science?" You might find this [[https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/sep/21/history-scientific-revolution-david-wootton][interview with David Wootton]] relevant.
[fn:cogito] Yet another way in which Descartes was a forward thinker was in writing his science, at least initially, in the vernacular (Galileo did this too). Rather than latin (Cogito ergo sum) his first phrasing of "I think therefore I am." was in French. By writing in his national language he made his writing more accessible to those without a classical background. Paradoxically, this may have made some of his work less accessible to the non-French for whom Latin was the international language of scientific discourse. Of course, one could always relay on breeding. What educated European of the time wouldn't have had at least a basic reading level knowledge of French, German, and Italian?
[fn:descartesBio] My own notes on Descartes life are all secondary and acquire piecemeal. I can't recall the sources for most of them. They are just a big pile of facts that I use to lecture. However, did find this [[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Descartes.html][site]] that offers a very nice overview.
